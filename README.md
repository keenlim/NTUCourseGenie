## Future Works

While NTU CourseGenie provides valuable assistance in course selection and planning process, there are several areas for further improvement to further enhance its functionality, usability and coverage. 

- Expanding Query Support: 

Currently, CourseGenie primarily provides course description and only support basic details, further enhancements such as the provision of course assessment styles, grading components and other key details that impact decision making can be provided. 

- Enabling Studend Feedback and Reviews

Serves as a one-stop Course Planning service which incorporates a student feedback system to enable users to share their experiences and insights about courses. Feedback can be further aggregated into structured ratings and reviews, making it easier for students to review their courses. 

- Enhancing the Course Roadmap Interface

Course planning roadmap can be redesigned with a more dynamic and interactive UI. Further updates wil include drag-and-drop functionality, visual timeline adjustments, and improved filtering options to streamling the planning process.

- Extending Course Coverage

Expanding the number of courses supported is one of the key priority. Currently, CourseGenie only covers courses offered by CCDS, hence, future iterations will broaden support to include more faculties and interdisciplinary programs. This will ensure a more comprehensive platform that caters to diverse academic pathways.
