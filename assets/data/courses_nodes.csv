CC0001,2,Inquiry & Communication in an Interdisciplinary World,"Researchers agree that writing is a tool for thinking (Menary, 2007; Klein & Boscolo, 2016; Miller and Jurecic, 2016; Reis, n.d.). As Reis explains, 'The bodily act of writing externalizes our thoughts, and the imposed structure (the written word) provides a vehicle by which those thoughts may be reorganized into new thinking, a new way of seeing the thoughts or a new way of organizing thoughts.' Miller and Jurecic similarly argue that 'writers discover what they think not before they write but in the act of writing' (2016, p. 60). One of the main aims of this course is to allow you to experience writing as a tool for thinking and to practice expressing ideas in formal writing and oral communication. While you will have the opportunity to understand and practice the genre conventions that are specific to your discipline later in your studies, this first common communication course is designed to help you form habits of mind that will serve you across the university and even in the world outside of the university.

SC4014,3,Concepts and Techniques for Malware Analysis,"Malware analysis is a specialization within cyber security. Malware attacks are often detrimental to companies or organizations. When malware breaches an organization's defences, the security team needs to act quickly to cure current infections and prevent it from re-occurring. Understanding the capabilities of the malware is critical to an organization's ability to quickly create a signature to prevent the widespread of the malware across the network, to block further communications from the attacker. This understanding could also be translated to valuable knowledge in identifying existing security gaps within an organization's system and fortify defences. This course aims to build a strong foundation to perform triage on malicious software using a variety of system and network monitoring utilities, a disassembler, a debugger and many other freely available tools."
SC4015,3,Cyber Physical System Security,"Cyber physical systems are typically designed as a network of interacting elements with physical input and output, and are characterized by the interaction between the physical world (sensors, user inputs, actuators) and the cyber world (processing, decision making).

Furthermore, our ability to comprehend our surroundings is heavily influenced by the activity of billions of neurons in our brain. Such complex systems can be represented as static or dynamic networks of many interacting components. These components are typically much simpler in terms of behavior or function than the overall system, implying that the additional complexity of the latter is an emergent network property.

It will help you to present yourself confidently, persuasively, and professionally in the way you speak, write and participate in your chosen profession. AB0602 starts with the basic - and well-rounded - premise that Communication Theory, Strategies and Skills are all needed in a highly complementary way for today's young executives preparing for workplace effectiveness. Theory provides a conceptual framework that guides strategy and skills. Strategy allows communicators to make intelligent choices about content, organisation, style, tone, delivery, and timing of messages. Skills are needed to craft effective written documents, give constructive feedback, and create as well as deliver persuasive business presentations. Throughout, the emphasis is on the art of persuasion for effectiveness in the corporate context. In addition, the course addresses other new demands in today's work culture. One such emerging demand is the need for effective Small Group Communication, a skill valued for collaborative work and team building. As such, you will be trained to go beyond prepared presentations to help you operate effectively in contexts which require spontaneous yet formal communication. Such contexts include small talk, meetings, team briefings and group discussions. Another new demand comes with the prevalence of online communication. To prepare for this trend, you will be guided to enhance your Executive Presence (EP) in both face-to-face and online settings, with special emphasis on social media and personal branding. Building on the theoretical foundation provided by EP experts, you will learn how to be an effective communicator across each medium - in-person, written or virtually - and in diverse situations. Finally, this course also offers you the opportunity to acquire an understanding of the method of Principled Negotiation developed by the Harvard Negotiation Project. You will gain hands-on experience in negotiation through engagement in negotiation simulations. To sum up, this course is planned to align with the broader vision of preparing you well for the workplace and address the increasingly complex needs of industry. As Mr. Ong Ye Kung, speaking as Acting Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills), has noted: 'IHLs (institutes of higher learning) must help students to build up their essential soft skills, such as interpersonal skills, working in teams and across cultures, the ability to communicate well, negotiate effectively, and be resourceful and enterprising.' Approximating the real-world work environment and culture to the extent possible for a course, the teaching approach consistently keeps the final outcome in mind: 'your development as a work-ready young executive able to operate in the corporate context with presence and persuasion.'"

HE1001,3,Microeconomics I,"The Singaporean Government is increasingly engaging the public, and as economists we are responsible for contributing towards better public decisions. This is especially important as good public policy processes place value on social impact, seeks to understand the behavior of Singapore's diverse society, and makes sense and use of increasingly abundant behavioral data. As the Singaporean economy gets more advanced and complex, and citizens get better educated and informed, we rely on decisions strengthened by sound economic thinking. The economist must move towards more rigorous reasoning across the levels of household, corporate, and public choice. In this course we apply fundamental microeconomic principles complemented by behavioral economics to various current everyday concerns in Singapore. The course aims to deliver a progressive and rigorous introduction to basic concepts and models of microeconomics, applied to current trends local and global. Microeconomics is one of the three core pillars of an Economics major. This is an important module that will serve as a prerequisite for almost all major PE modules. The first part of the course covers the theory of individual decision-making in consumption, risk and labor. The second part of the course covers the theory of firms making production decisions when operating under various market structures, in particular price discrimination with market power and strategic interactions between firms. This course will also expose students to new developments in the field of microeconomics which have now come to assume a central role, in particular behavioral economics. Students will learn basic theories that can be abstract and simple but yet so relevant and powerful in explaining decision problems in our everyday lives. On the one hand, it will give students with either no previous economics training a chance to close the gap with those with a stronger background.

In the first half of the course, we focus on how individuals make their decisions in the market by discussing two broad topics. The first is the analysis of price and income changes in the market. This discussion builds on what have already been covered in Principals of Microeconomics. The second topic is individual decision-making regarding time, risk, and uncertainty where we will also examine how the asset market works. In the second half of the course, we focus on analysing the welfare effects of outcomes in markets and society.
