CSC,Computer Science Programme ,Bachelor of Computing (Hons) in Computer Science,Single Degree,"The programme emphasises the practical design and integration of efficient and reliable software algorithms, data structures and computing paradigms needed to tackle the increasingly complex computational requirements of the diverse and fast growing Infocomm sectors.Computer Science shares some common topics with Computer Engineering, including computer networks, information storage and management. Both disciplines share fundamental principles as each recognises the constraints imposed by existing technology and applications. The differences are in the emphasis placed at the algorithmic and conceptual levels. Computer Science focuses more on software design and construction, and does not include subjects on circuits, basic electronics, or digital communications. ","1.
