Further, there will be a detailed treatment of the security challenges for cyber physical systems, which vary in practice due to the diverse nature of the application environment of cyber physical systems. These different forms of security breaches, observed across diverse cyber physical systems, will be put in a well-characterized taxonomy, to be systematically identified as attack surfaces. The techniques to handle these attacks will be described in a generic manner, including key management and wireless/RFID communication. The attack surfaces and protection/mitigation principles will then be elaborated with practical case studies, from the representative cyber physical systems such as automotive, smart card systems and smart grid.', 'title': 'Cyber Physical System Security'}}]","The course SC4015, titled ""Cyber Physical System Security,"" is a 3 academic unit course.

We then move into the fundamental topic of solving system of linear equations and learn the Gaussian elimination algorithm, an idea that pervades the entire course. In the second half of the course we revisit these ideas in a more abstract way, learning about general vector spaces, linear independence, and the fundamental subspaces associated with a matrix.

Description: Seminars and Workshops - Throughout the MDP, students will be required to attend relevant seminars and workshops that would help them understand the process and tools for designing, developing, and marketing real-world multidisciplinary products. These include both general and technical seminars. General seminars may cover topics such as guided innovation, multidisciplinary problem solving, working effectively in engineering teams, understanding effective marketing strategies, project management, professional, ethical, and moral responsibilities, etc. Technical seminars and workshops will be related to specific engineering methodology and tools that can help students implement their respective ideas. These may include systems engineering and design, large-scale web systems, embedded systems development tools, etc. In their implementation, students will have to factor in appropriate considerations for public health and safety, cultural, societal factors, environmental and other constraints as well as the needs for sustainable development.

Laboratories - Laboratory during MDP will be a mix of guided and open-access sessions.

Teams - Students will be grouped into teams of about 6-7 members. The composition of these team members will consist of a multidisciplinary mix of CS, CE, and BCG students.

Supervision - Each team will be assigned a faculty mentor during the MDP.","[{'c': {'courseCode': 'SC2079', 'academicUnits': 4, 'description': 'Seminars and Workshops - Throughout the MDP, students will be required to attend relevant seminars and workshops that would help them understand the process and tools for designing, developing and marketing of real-world multidisciplinary products.
