Cyber physical systems are characterized by stringent performance requirements, such as, extremely low energy budget, small area footprint and often hard real-time constraints.

The techniques to handle these attacks will be described in a generic manner, including key management and wireless/RFID communication. The attack surfaces and protection/mitigation principles will then be elaborated with practical case studies, from the representative cyber physical systems such as automotive, smart card systems and smart grid.', 'title': 'Cyber Physical System Security'}, 'yearReqs': ['Year 3'], 'groupLogic': None, 'groupId': None, 'groupReqs': [], 'directReqs': ['SC1006']}]","The course SC4015, titled ""Cyber Physical System Security,"" is a 3 academic unit course.
