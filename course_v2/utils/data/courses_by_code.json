Miller and Jurecic similarly argue that 'writers discover what they think not before they write but in the act of writing' (2016, p. 60). One of the main aims of this course is to allow you to experience writing as a tool for thinking and to practice expressing ideas in formal writing and oral communication. While you will have the opportunity to understand and practice the genre conventions that are specific to your discipline later in your studies, this first common communication course is designed to help you form habits of mind that will serve you across the university and even in the world outside of the university. Taken by all first-year undergraduates, this foundational course will develop your written and oral communication skills, as well as your ability to read and analyze texts.

When malware breaches an organization's defences, the security team needs to act quickly to cure current infections and prevent it from re-occurring. Understanding the capabilities of the malware is critical to an organization's ability to quickly create a signature to prevent the widespread of the malware across the network, to block further communications from the attacker. This understanding could also be translated to valuable knowledge in identifying existing security gaps within an organization's system and fortify defences. This course aims to build a strong foundation to perform triage on malicious software using a variety of system and network monitoring utilities, a disassembler, a debugger and many other freely available tools.",

    "description": "Cyber physical systems are typically designed as a network of interacting elements with physical input and output, and are characterized by the interaction between the physical world (sensors, user inputs, actuators) and the cyber world (processing, decision making). Cyber physical systems are the driving force behind modern civilization, being integral part of technologies, such as additive manufacturing, smartcard-based payment, power delivery systems, drone-based operations, and smart home automation. Cyber physical systems are characterized by stringent performance requirements, such as, extremely low energy budget, small area footprint and often hard real-time constraints. Due to the pervasive nature of the cyber physical systems in our everyday lives, it also runs the risk of huge security hazards. In this course, we will learn about the basics of cyber physical systems, including the design principles and methodologies. Further, there will be a detailed treatment of the security challenges for cyber physical systems, which vary in practice due to the diverse nature of the application environment of cyber physical systems. These different forms of security breaches, observed across diverse cyber physical systems, will be put in a well-characterized taxonomy, to be systematically identified as attack surfaces. The techniques to handle these attacks will be described in a generic manner, including key management and wireless/RFID communication. The attack surfaces and protection/mitigation principles will then be elaborated with practical case studies, from the representative cyber physical systems such as automotive, smart card systems and smart grid.",

These products may exhibit varied levels of complexity, spanning from being raw and derived data, intelligence and services derived from or driven by data, enabled by algorithmic and statistical tools such as machine learning. In many data products, the role of data can be subtle and the overall product may be composed of other modules, which could be more prominent in appearance. The scope of this course is confined to the exploration of the life-cycle of typical data products that deploy data-science dominantly or exclusively. We will deconstruct individual components across the full stack: ranging from data acquisition, wrangling and storage, testing, validation, and refinement - spanning exploratory analysis, issues of visualization and presentation, and application of machine learning techniques for decision support, anomaly detection and recommendation systems. We will explore this course with hands-on examples, illustrating how some data products utilize only a subset of these components, while others deploy the wider gamut. This course will also expose techniques to handle various kinds of data on their own and in conjunction, e.g., natural language data, datetime and timeseries, geoseries and graph data; the underlying systems and algorithms to support, analyze and learn using such data to build data products. Overall, in this course, we will describe several fundamental principles, and we will illustrate them in action using hands-on examples and tools. The choice of algorithms and software packages will be representative but not exhaustive. As such, the detailed description of course content uses 'e.g.,' to give possible indicative instances, but the actual delivery of the course may choose other tools, programming languages, frameworks and examples (including or excluding the indicative instances). Furthermore, the instantiation of tools and examples could vary over time, based on practical considerations, e.g., maturity and popularity of the tools among practitioners. The course will be delivered inter-mixing live lectures and hands-on exercises blended with some parts of the lectures offered in pre-recorded TEL format and curated reading materials.",

It will help you to present yourself confidently, persuasively, and professionally in the way you speak, write and participate in your chosen profession. AB0602 starts with the basic - and well-rounded - premise that Communication Theory, Strategies and Skills are all needed in a highly complementary way for today's young executives preparing for workplace effectiveness. Theory provides a conceptual framework that guides strategy and skills. Strategy allows communicators to make intelligent choices about content, organisation, style, tone, delivery, and timing of messages. Skills are needed to craft effective written documents, give constructive feedback, and create as well as deliver persuasive business presentations. Throughout, the emphasis is on the art of persuasion for effectiveness in the corporate context. In addition, the course addresses other new demands in today's work culture. One such emerging demand is the need for effective Small Group Communication, a skill valued for collaborative work and team building. As such, you will be trained to go beyond prepared presentations to help you operate effectively in contexts which require spontaneous yet formal communication. Such contexts include small talk, meetings, team briefings and group discussions. Another new demand comes with the prevalence of online communication. To prepare for this trend, you will be guided to enhance your Executive Presence (EP) in both face-to-face and online settings, with special emphasis on social media and personal branding. Building on the theoretical foundation provided by EP experts, you will learn how to be an effective communicator across each medium - in-person, written or virtually - and in diverse situations. Finally, this course also offers you the opportunity to acquire an understanding of the method of Principled Negotiation developed by the Harvard Negotiation Project. You will gain hands-on experience in negotiation through engagement in negotiation simulations. To sum up, this course is planned to align with the broader vision of preparing you well for the workplace and address the increasingly complex needs of industry. As Mr. Ong Ye Kung, speaking as Acting Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills), has noted: 'IHLs (institutes of higher learning) must help students to build up their essential soft skills, such as interpersonal skills, working in teams and across cultures, the ability to communicate well, negotiate effectively, and be resourceful and enterprising.' Approximating the real-world work environment and culture to the extent possible for a course, the teaching approach consistently keeps the final outcome in mind: 'your development as a work-ready young executive able to operate in the corporate context with presence and persuasion.'",

    "description": "The Singaporean Government is increasingly engaging the public, and as economists we are responsible for contributing towards better public decisions. This is especially important as good public policy processes place value on social impact, seeks to understand the behavior of Singapore's diverse society, and makes sense and use of increasingly abundant behavioral data. As the Singaporean economy gets more advanced and complex, and citizens get better educated and informed, we rely on decisions strengthened by sound economic thinking. The economist must move towards more rigorous reasoning across the levels of household, corporate, and public choice. In this course we apply fundamental microeconomic principles complemented by behavioral economics to various current everyday concerns in Singapore. The course aims to deliver a progressive and rigorous introduction to basic concepts and models of microeconomics, applied to current trends local and global. Microeconomics is one of the three core pillars of an Economics major. This is an important module that will serve as a prerequisite for almost all major PE modules. The first part of the course covers the theory of individual decision-making in consumption, risk and labor. The second part of the course covers the theory of firms making production decisions when operating under various market structures, in particular price discrimination with market power and strategic interactions between firms. This course will also expose students to new developments in the field of microeconomics which have now come to assume a central role, in particular behavioral economics. Students will learn basic theories that can be abstract and simple but yet so relevant and powerful in explaining decision problems in our everyday lives. On the one hand, it will give students with either no previous economics training a chance to close the gap with those with a stronger background. On the other hand, it will give everyone a chance to appreciate microeconomics in action right from the start of their education at NTU - a feature that is surprisingly amiss in many Economics undergraduate programs worldwide.",

In the first half of the course, we focus on how individuals make their decisions in the market by discussing two broad topics. The first is the analysis of price and income changes in the market. This discussion builds on what have already been covered in Principals of Microeconomics. The second topic is individual decision-making regarding time, risk, and uncertainty where we will also examine how the asset market works. In the second half of the course, we focus on analysing the welfare effects of outcomes in markets and society. To this end, students will learn different measures of welfare and criteria for efficiency, and how perfectly competitive markets help achieve socially optimal outcomes. Subsequently, we will discuss the problems related to making choices for society and how these may be reconciled.",

We will first study the basics of game theory, analysing strategic interactions between small numbers of agents and discuss its applications. Subsequently, we will study various kinds of market frictions and how they can lead to sub-optimal outcomes in the market, covering possible solutions. This will include classical ones like asymmetric information, classical externalities and common access and also newer ones like information technology.
